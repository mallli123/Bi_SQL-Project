##Pizza Sales Report
In this Project, I harnessed the power of SQL to extract valuable insights from our pizza sales data. Then, I transformed these raw numbers into compelling visuals using Power BI to provide a holistic view of pizza business performance.

##My Dashboard Showcases Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) that matter most:
Total Orders
Total Pizzas Sold
Total Revenue
I have also included a monthly trend analysis, giving us insights into how our business fluctuates throughout the year.
From a granular perspective, I have delved into daily trends, helping us understand when our pizzas are flying out the door.
Additionally, I have segmented our pizza offerings by category and revealed which pizza sizes are our top sellers. This knowledge can drive strategic decisions to optimize our menu.
